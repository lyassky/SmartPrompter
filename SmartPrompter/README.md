Good Morning! 

Here are some documentation notes regarding setup and @lyassky changes (June/July 2019) on my fork of the SmartPrompter app, which was created by @lehmansarahm January 2019. This development occured during the 2019 Temple REU for Pervasive Computing for Smart Health, Safety, and Well-Being in Dr. Chiu Tan's research lab.
